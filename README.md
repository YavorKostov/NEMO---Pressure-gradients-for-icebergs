# NEMO---Pressure-gradients-for-icebergs
Horizontal pressure gradients in iceberg dynamics.

The derivation of the formulas applicable to icebergs is uploaded here:

The code updates concerning horizontal pressure gradients have been tested using verification configurations such as the one made available in the ICB repository. Beware that this repository differs from the ICB test configuration that comes with NEMO 4.2.
